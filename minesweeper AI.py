"""
This program captures your screen, processes the image, identifies squares that are mines and squares that are safe, and send click signals and completes the game.
I created three algorithms to determine which squares are mines and which squares are safe.
The first is the Straightforward Algorithm, where two logical operations are set in place:
1. If the number of covered squares around a number is equal to the number, then all covered squares around the number are mines.
2. If the number of flagged squares around a number is equal to the number, then all other squares around the number that are not flagged are safe.
(If you play Minesweeper you'll know what I'm talking about)
In the code the algorithm is just named calculate()
The second is Subset Elimination, where I'm comparing a square with a number and the covered squares around it, with its neighboring numbers and their neighboring covered squares, to try to calculate which squares are mines and which squares and safe.
The third is The Tank Solver Algorithm, the juice of this program, and the algorithm I am most proud of.
It will recursively iterate through all possible arrangemnets of mines given a list of locations, and count the number of times each square is a mine.
If a square is a mine in all possible arrangements, then the square is for sure a mine, and if a square is safe in all possible arrangements, then the square is for sure safe.
These algorithms increase in computational expense:
The Straightforward Algorithm and Subset Elimination provide cheap ways to solve the board, but they cannot handle all situations in Minesweeper, and that's why you need the Tank Solver Algorithm to handle all situations.
