# Minesweeper-AI
Original by Tom
Written when I was in grade 11
It works on my MacBook pro, and there is no guarantee that it works on other computers.
It solves Google minesweeper's hard mode, and does not work on other versions or modes
It only works on hard mode because I'm too lazy to add the parameters for easy and medium modes. They're the same ideas.

Video of it solving minesweeper 10 times in a row: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC_69iGVnCo
Note there was a problem in the video where the AI could not solve one of the end-game circumstances, but the problem has been resolved, and I did not bother recording again; and the code here is the complete version.
Libraries used: opencv, pyautogui
Algorithms created: The Straightforward Algorithm, Subset Elimination, The Tank Solver Algorithm
GPT use: only for image processing and coding help; the algorithms are completely original. Although I got ideas of the algorithms from the internet, I did not look at their code; I just came up with them.
Time taken to build: over 100 hours
