# Minesweeper-AI
Original by Tom  
Written when I was in grade 11  
This program solves Google's Minesweeper game (hard mode).  
Basically it recursively takes screenshots of your screen, determines where the mines are, send click signals to your computer, and solving Minesweeper for you.  
Video of it solving minesweeper 10 times in a row: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC_69iGVnCo  
It works on my MacBook pro, and there is no guarantee that it works on other computers.  
Libraries used: opencv, pyautogui  
Algorithms created: The Straightforward Algorithm, Subset Elimination, The Tank Solver Algorithm  
GPT use: only for image processing and coding help; the algorithms are completely original. Although I got ideas of the algorithms from the internet, I did not look at their code; I just came up with them.  
Time taken to build: over 100 hours
