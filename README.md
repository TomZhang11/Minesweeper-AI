# Minesweeper-AI
Original by Tom Zhang
It works on my MacBook pro, and there is no guarantee that it works on other computers.
It solves Google's minesweeper, and does not work on other versions
Video of it solving minesweeper 10 times in a row: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC_69iGVnCo
Note there was a problem in the video where the AI could not solve one of the end-game circumstances, but the problem has been resolved, and I did not bother recording again; and the code here is the complete version.
Language used: python
Libraries used: opencv, pyautogui
Algorithms created: The Straightforward Algorithm, Subset Elimination, The Tank Solver Algorithm
Time complexity: idk
ChatGPT (or other AI) use: only for image processing and coding help; the algorithms are completely original. Although I got ideas of the algorithms from the internet, I did not look at their code; I just came up with them.
Time taken to build: over 100 hours
Note there is only a python script which cannot be executed directly by the computer. To execute this python script, you will need a python interpreter which can be downloaded at python's official website
